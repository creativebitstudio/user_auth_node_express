# User_auth_node_express

This is a user authentication application using sessions and cookies as authentication.

Technologies used are node, express, mongo store (with mongoose), and middleware (express-session).

Note: feel free to use this application as part of a web project, however, if used in production, consider security when implememnting this code. For starters, always use HTTPs and consider modifying code to add even more authentication.
